				<h2>Bjoern Cheng Yi: Fast Algorithm for Computing the Penetration Depth between Polyhedra</h2>
			</div>
			<div id="inside_div">
				<p>
					Nowadays, simulation is widely used in different area, such as robot simulation and game engines; however, nowadays simulator cannot simulate contacts between polyhedra reliably, which makes it not possible to even simulate a simple task like picking a polyhedron shaped object in a simulation. The key reason is the contact simulating mechanism is using only local information of the polyhedra which causes the simulation to be unstable and inaccurate. To overcome this challenge, another mechanism is designed so that the simulator now uses the global penetration depth of the two objects to simulate contacts. The problem now is that finding the penetration depth of two object is hard and time consuming. A current existing algorithm has a O(n^2) time complexity where n is the total number of features of the two algorithm. This project presented a faster algorithm that only runs in O(nlog(n)) time complexity.
